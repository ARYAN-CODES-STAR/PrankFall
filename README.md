# 🎩✨ QuantumFlux UI: The Gravitational Prank That Defied Conventional Web Development

**"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."**  
*— Arthur C. Clarke (though we think he might have been using this framework)*

## 🌌 Overview

Behold the culmination of 72 hours of caffeinated brilliance - a web interface where **DOM elements obey the laws of physics**, complete with gravitational pull, mouse-based quantum entanglement, and the occasional spacetime anomaly. What started as an April Fools' joke evolved into a revolutionary reimagining of web interactions (or at least a really fun way to prank your colleagues).

## 🚀 Key Features (Because Genius Demands Recognition)

- **🪐 Quantum-Entangled UI Physics**  
  Elements with mass (divs heavier than 300px get 20% more gravity - because science)

- **🌀 Mouse Event Horizon**  
  Cursor creates gravitational pull that warps nearby components

- **⚡ Spacetime Continuum Protection**  
  Collision detection that would make Newton proud (if he knew TypeScript)

- **🎭 Schrödinger's Prank**  
  Is it a groundbreaking UI framework? Is it a joke? Why not both?

- **🌪️ Black Hole Mode**  
  Right-click anywhere to create temporary CSS singularities (don't tell the physicists)

## 🧠 Technical Marvels (For Those Who Appreciate Brilliance)

### The Einstein-Level Innovations
```tsx
// Behold the gravity engine core (simplified for mortal comprehension)
const animate = () => {
  // Apply quantum mouse dynamics
  if (isHovered) {
    velocityRef.current.x += (dx / distance) * quantumRepulsion;
    velocityRef.current.y += (dy / distance) * quantumRepulsion;
  }

  // Newtonian physics (with better error handling than the universe)
  velocityRef.current.y += gravity * massCoefficient;
  positionRef.current.x += velocityRef.current.x * spacetimeFriction;
  
  // Heisenberg compensator (prevents uncertainty in CSS transforms)
  applyUnseenPhysics();
};
